I hope you are doing great and reading this correspondence in best of your health and being.

Through this epistle as a medium, I would like to propose an addition of ad removal feature in our platform. The project summary is trifurcated as following:

1. **Aim** is to embed `"Remove ad"` action in the video settings menu along with `"Skip ad"` action to the in-stream advertisements during a plackback.   
    - This feature is currently available only at premium version.
  
2. **Benefit** : The provision will allow the user to enjoy time bound ad-free content consumption, especially users interested in Skill Development and DIY content.
    - At present a user must avail Premium Membership for such features. 
  The feature addition will provide the user an option to bypass the detail page.  
  
3. **Objective** of this project is to improve the overall customer experience by
    - Making uninterrupted viewing experience.
    - Making user choices valued.
    - Providing user more flexibility. 

Upon successfull implementation of the project, it is expected to have improved overall user experience . 
I would request you to kindly find the detailed overview in the attached Product Requirement Document (PRD). 

Please feel free to reach me in case of any query, concern or assistance. Will be happy to help.
