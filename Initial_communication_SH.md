Dear *Name of stakeholder*,
#


I hope you are doing great and reading this correspondence in best of your health and being.

Through this epistle as a medium, I would like to propose an addition of feature in our product page. The project summary is trifurcated as following:

1. **Aim** is to embed `"Add to basket"` action at out category listing page. 
    - This feature is currently available only at the product detail view.
  
2. **Benefit** : The provision will allow the cx to add a product straight from the listings, while maintaining the eagle view of the category page.
    - At present a customer must leave the category view, move to the detail page to move the product in the basket. 
  The feature addition will provide the user an option to bypass the detail page.  
  
3. **Objective** of this project is to improve the overall customer experience by
    - Making the path of "listing - to - cart" shorter.
    - Making user's experience more lucid and uninterrupted. 

Upon successfull implementation of the project, it is expected to have increased conversion rate and improved knowledge base for BI and Marketing Analytics. 
I would request you to kindly find the detailed overview in the attached Product Requirement Document (PRD). 

Please feel free to reach me in case of any query, concern or assistance. Will be happy to help.
