## Background and Strategic Fit

The landing shelf in desktop image for any given product category contains product listings with product image, brand name, colors available and price. Once the user take the 
cursor over the product image, secondary information is projected such as available sizes and "add to wishlist" icon (top right corner). Thus a clean and abstractive user view
is maintained. 

However, the user have to click at the product image and move into the product detail page in order to add the particular product to the basket. Thus the product detail page is
always an interface for a product's transition from the listing page to the basket. The objective is to provide an option to bypass this process, allowing the user to maintain
the landing shelf on the screen, save time & efforts and maintain an uninterrupted shopping experience. 

## Success Criteria

Upon successful completion of this project, the end user will be able to add a product to their shopping basket directly from the category page with a feedback notification which we expect will improve overall shopping experience of end user.
