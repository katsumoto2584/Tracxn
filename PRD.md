# PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT

## Background

YouTube's primary sources of revenue is Advertisements. While the focused revenue model benefits the users (owner), frequent in-feed video ads can  be a factor in dwindled user experience.

The "in-feed ads" on the video streaming platform are:

 -  Skippable in-stream ads
 -  Non-skippable in-stream ads
 -  In-feed video ads
 -  Bumper ads
 -  Outstream ads
 -  Masthead ads

While In-feed video, Bumper and outstream ads appear in either the search page or during the video playback in the form of a banner or a short message, *Skippable in-stream and Non- skippable in-stream ads* can be place in the beginning, during or in the end of the playback, which affects the overall viewing experience directly.

In an event where the user is forced to watch ad(s) multiple time during an *interrupted playback* of the same content, the overall experience receives a significant amount of damage.
