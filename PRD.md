# PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT

## Background

YouTube's primary sources of revenue is Advertisements. While the focused revenue model benefits the users (owner), frequent in-feed video ads can  be a factor in dwindled user experience.

The "in-feed ads" on the video streaming platform are:

 -  Skippable in-stream ads
 -  Non-skippable in-stream ads
 -  In-feed video ads
 -  Bumper ads
 -  Outstream ads
 -  Masthead ads

While In-feed video, Bumper and outstream ads appear in either the search page or during the video playback in the form of a banner or a short message, *Skippable in-stream and Non- skippable in-stream ads* can be place in the beginning, during or in the end of the playback, which affects the overall viewing experience directly. 

> Initially, the in-stream ads could be skipped anytime and were limited to a couple in about 1 hour playback. However, over the time the frequency has been changed to > 1 ad in every 10 min. In certain cases a user can be forced to watch 12 cascaded (double - 24 ads) ads during a *single playback* of 60 min, the overall experience receives a significant amount of damage.
